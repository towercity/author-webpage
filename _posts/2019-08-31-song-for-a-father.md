Oh how time moves: I've been published in [Vamp Cat](https://www.vampcatmag.com/) for a month or so now, and I didn't realize.

You can check out a link to the story [here](https://www.vampcatmag.com/post/song-father-jakob-konger). It's called **Song for a Father**. It's an obvious retelling, but I still like it.

I'll be adding a publications page to my sidebar soon.
