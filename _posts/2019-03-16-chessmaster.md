In the interest of further using this blog, here's a thing I found in recent days.

The other day I was talking to S-- about gameboy games my brother and I had as kids, and I swore I had had a game called "The Chessmaster" (a simple, boring, chess game), and that the title screen spoke the words "Welcome to Chessmaster" when you turned the game on. S-- believed me, but to be honest I hardly believed myself. How could a Gameboy game play actual recorded sounds, and not only blips and other chipsounds, especially since this wasn't even a gameboy color game?

Well, long story short, today I looked the game up, and not only did the title screen have vocal samples, the whole thing used audio samples--not just vocal samples ("Check!", "Checkmate!"), but also what I guess you would call music (the sound effects that play when each player moves). The audio quality is _very_ low, and there's no background music, just the strange samples. It's a really strange feel overall. The heavily affected sounds, together with the pixelated wizarldy old man on the title screen, gives the whole game a surreal, inhuman aesthetic. It seems nightmarish to me, but that's probably cause the game--a really basic chess game--affected my nightmares as a kid. Anyways, since I've built it up so much, check out the video below. It's really worth the 30 second watch.
