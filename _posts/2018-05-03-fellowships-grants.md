I'm approaching the end of my MFA degree in the next year, which means if I want to be paid to write, I need to start looking at grants and fellowships. There's a lot of places that post these online though--a lot--and given the fact that thier due dates are often staggered across the year, and that I have a terrible brain for memorizing anything institutional, especially dates, I know I need a place to record them for myself. I could write them down, of course, but then I'm unable to update my records, or even reorganize them. 

Thus (if you haven't already guessed) my reason for this blog post: over the next few years and months I will be updating this space with information on grants and fellowships I come across, with maybe some information on my own application process. I'm doing this mostly for myself, but if you've happened to stumble upon it, feel free to you use it as your own database as well. I'm doing this for no money--not even exposure--but just for my own use, so at the very least you'll know it's somewhere you can trust.

For now, I'm setting these all out on a single page, but in the future I may move to giving grants individual pages, in order to make use of jekyll's tagging features.

### Grants ##

#### Hodson Trust – John Carter Brown Library Fellowship  ####

__Webpage:__ [x](https://www.washcoll.edu/centers/starr/fellowships/hodson-brown-fellowship.php)

__Due Date:__ Likely March 2019

__Length:__ Four months

__Amount:__ $20,000, or $5,000 a month

__Location:__ John Carter Brown Library, Brown Univeristy, Providence RI

__Requirements:__ For writers "working on significant projects relating to the literature, history, culture, or art of the Americas before 1830... Candidates are encouraged to consult the John Carter Brown Library’s [collections](http://www.brown.edu/academics/libraries/john-carter-brown/about/collection) online prior to submitting an application."

__Notes:__ This one, for its specificity, may be a good choice. I have a bent toward historical fiction, obviously, and this is a time (I assume) few people are writting about.

### Future Possibilities ###
ie, fellowships that require book publications, etc.

* [American Academy in Berlin](http://www.americanacademy.de/apply/apply-for-a-fellowship/)
* [Hodder Fellowship, Princeton](http://arts.princeton.edu/fellowships/hodder-fellowship/)
* [NEA Creative Writing Fellowships](https://www.arts.gov/grants-individuals/creative-writing-fellowships): I _am_ eligible for this, and it's for fiction this upcoming year, but thye haven't updated the information from poetry. Look at later.
