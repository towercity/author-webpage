I'm approaching the end of my MFA degree in the next year, which means if I want to be paid to write, I need to start looking at grants and fellowships. There's a lot of places that post these online though--a lot--and given the fact that their due dates are often staggered across the year, and that I have a terrible brain for memorizing anything institutional, especially dates, I know I need a place to record them for myself. I could write them down, of course, but then I'm unable to update my records, or even reorganize them.

Thus (if you haven't already guessed) my reason for this blog post: over the next few years and months I will be updating this space with information on grants and fellowships I come across, with maybe some information on my own application process. I'm doing this mostly for myself, but if you've happened to stumble upon it, feel free to you use it as your own database as well. I'm doing this for no money--not even exposure--but just for my own use, so at the very least you'll know it's somewhere you can trust.

For now, I'm setting these all out on a single page, but in the future I may move to giving grants individual pages, in order to make use of jekyll's tagging features.

And, as a final note, all of these are either fully paid, have a chance to be fully paid, or come with a nice, comfortable stipend.

### Grants ##

#### Hodson Trust – John Carter Brown Library Fellowship  ####

__Notes:__ This one, for its specificity, may be a good choice. I have a bent toward historical fiction, obviously, and this is a time (I assume) few people are writing about.

### Future Possibilities ###
ie, fellowships that require book publications, etc.

* [American Academy in Berlin](http://www.americanacademy.de/apply/apply-for-a-fellowship/)
* [Hodder Fellowship, Princeton](http://arts.princeton.edu/fellowships/hodder-fellowship/)
* [NEA Creative Writing Fellowships](https://www.arts.gov/grants-individuals/creative-writing-fellowships): I _am_ eligible for this, and it's for fiction this upcoming year, but thye haven't updated the information from poetry. Look at later.
* [Writers in Paradise](https://www.writersinparadise.com/): like NEA, I'm eligible; it's just not updated for 2019 yet. Check it, b/c it's short and close.
* [Bard Fiction Prize](http://www.bard.edu/bfp/)
* [1901 James Merrill House](http://jamesmerrillhouse.org/residency/writer-in-residence-program/): They offer both a 4 1/2 month residency and a few shorter ones throughout the year. The info isn't up yet, as the application window is closed, but it will likely go back up in October.
* [Bread Loaf](http://www.middlebury.edu/bread-loaf-conferences/admissions): It's a good choice, but most scholarships require (soft and hard requirements both) prior publication; return once you're a known entity.
