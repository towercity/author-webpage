To make things a bit easier, I'm now separating my 'possible' grants and fellowships from my 'currently working ons', and this is the place I'm putting the applications I'm currently working on (as well as, hopefully, the status of these apps). Beyond this, I believe the rest of this page will be pretty self-explanatory. Best case scenario it leads to a future of financial psuedo-stability.

### George Bennet Fellowship  ###

__Webpage:__ [x](https://www.exeter.edu/about-us/career-opportunities/fellowships/writer-residence-george-bennett-fellowship)

__Type:__ In-person fellowship

__Due Date:__ September 30, 2018

__Length:__ One year(!)

__Amount:__ $15,570

__Location:__ Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, NH

__Requirements:__ It leans towards fiction, per the description, and would _prefer_ a manuscript in-progress. The time is meant to be used towards the research/creation of a longer project, so hinging your application on a novel- or series-length idea seems like the way to go

__Notes:__ I _think_ this is the boarding school fellowship, which is very strange. The site says your only real job duty is _being there_ as a _resource_ for the students, so I imagine this means being a half-enthused Robin Williams figure for future students of Dartmouth. Odd, but possibly instructive(?)
